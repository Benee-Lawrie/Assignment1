        Creating my web page was both an exciting and challenging experience that provided valuable insights into the world of web development. 
        One of the main challenges I encountered was navigating the vast array of technologies and tools available, making it difficult to choose the most suitable ones for my project.
                The initial learning curve was steep, especially when delving into HTML and CSS to build the foundation of the page.
                Debugging and troubleshooting issues with the layout and compatibility added an extra layer of complexity.

                The best parts about creating this web page is my ability to spot errors and make effort to correct them.
        Therefore, I'm happy about my growth and consistencies.
